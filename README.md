License plate detection

Method
Project is developed using python and opencv . machine learning is not used to detect number plate . It is based on contour in opencv . it's dosent give you numbers directly it's just highlights (gives you the coordinate ) the rectangular area of number plate in image.


Imutils-
A series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV and both Python 2.7 and Python 3.
